# User guideline


After opening this project, you can begin to use it by clicking the start icon and entering the game scene.

If the sky exposure ratio of one position is needed, you can just click any position of the scene and the number will be shown in the button on the right bottom button. It is a number range from 0 to 100 in which 0 means the position can not get any sunlight while 100 means there is no shelter at all.

If landscape visibility is needed, users need to first click the Visibility index button and then the visibility index will show on the same button.

If the shadow variant is needed, the heatmap button can be clicked, and then the tool will go into the shadow variant calculation function. The heatmap visualizes this parameter with different colors. A redder area means it is in shadow for a longer time during the daytime while black means there is no shadowed time.

If the CFH pattern is clicked, the changing frequency heatmap will display in the game scene.

If the show barchart button is clicked, users can then click any position. And this tool will show how the light intensity at that position. While the day/night circle function starts, the bar chart will vary according to the light intensity change of the time.
